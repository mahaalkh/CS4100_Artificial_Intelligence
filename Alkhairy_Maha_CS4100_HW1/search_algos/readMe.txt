Both heuristics take around one minute to compute the answer and the reason behind that is that I am using the mazeDistance when computing the heuristic because the maze distance is computing the actual distance. 


For the heuristic for problem 6, the heuristic first computes the maze distance from the given node to the food points and then returns the maximum value in the list of distances because of the possibility of going to the furthest food first. 


For the heuristic for problem 7, It is similar to heuristic for problem 6 with a minor change, the the heuristic first computes the manhattan distance from the given node to the food points and then returns the maximum value in the list of distances because of the possibility of going to the furthest food first.
